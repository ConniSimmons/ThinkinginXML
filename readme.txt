How do you think XML relates to HTML? 
    XML is a compliment to HTML in that it keeps data in a clear, organized form that can be altered without changing how it appears in a presentation.

What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?  
    It's nice to pull data from XML because if the data within XML changes, it doesn't change the XTML or HOW it displays data.

What are some disadvantages? 
    The fact that the data in XML needs to be run through a process before it can be displayed is a disadvantage.  No browsers can display it in a useful form.  There can also be conflicts within XML when combining datasets.  It's easy to use the same name for different categories of information.
